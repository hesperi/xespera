master branch for the main hesperi website https://ir.hesperi.net
right now, im going through a lot of planning to figure out what to do with the main site. ive rebuilt it several times already, trying to come up with something good for it, but ive finally decided on what ill do...
as of now, i am making the ir.hesperi.net webpage more professional, and maybe bring in some people curious to see what we're about. 
i have no clue what we're about. this is a project company, not a full on corporation. right now our primary focus is web design and a couple of other projects relating to server networking. ill update this page when i get more stuff figured out.

and again, thank you for the support...
