  <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>i'm trying to learn html the right way, but i dont think it's working. i'm adding redundant shit and stuff. i've only just started because of a<br>chance of a lifetime and i'm willing to take it!</p>
      <br>
  <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>::UD1:: i am still learning basic pieces of HTML. i have only covered paragraphs, tags, headings, links, etc. i am making decent progress i think!</p>
    <p>::UD2:: i added some other little shits to my HTML to try it out.</p>

<!--excluded the <meta> because i don't know how to use it. excluded <tag> because i dont know what that tag is. excluded the <style> because i personally dont like to mix HTML and CSS in the same file.-->
<!--included <h1> <h2> titles n shit. included target attribute so it'll open a new tab/window instead of overriding the origin webpage. i put shit in a way that makes sense to me.-->
